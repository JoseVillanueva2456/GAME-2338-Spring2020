**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ Overall the mechanics are very simple. It is told in the description of the game that it is a point and click game, but in game it does not specifically tell you what to do except for an arrow point where to click (not hard to figure out).

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ In the playtest, the only thing that I found to be an extra was a clickable firefly that unlocks a picture that could be viewed in the menu of the game (no need for removal).

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ In the beginning (at least in my playtest) it was pretty straight forward until I ran into the music note mechanic that I found to correspond to the alphabet (notes look like letters) were you are supposed to play for a crying person (game hints at that), but doesn't give a good hint at what order to play in (looking at the answer in a video "happy", would cause most people (more than likely children) a headache to guess that, especially if they don't see the notes as letters).

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ As for a point and click, the player kind of creates their own timing, only slowing down when confused as how to continue.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ For this game it was not uncommon to gain items to use for another area/thing to click on, the music note is not hard to grasp either and blended in with the game as a key to solving puzzles.

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ It was ok, point and click games can't get too interesting (even in a more story driven approach like "[The Bunker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/481110/The_Bunker/)". The enjoyment really comes from the visuals/story (which were nice).

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ The only problem that I ran into was a wierldy placed "clickable" where you are able to cross a pond but was required to click in a certian area as opposed to other new area movement clicks.
