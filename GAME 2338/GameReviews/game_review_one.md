### Rating
Overall, I would give this game a **3** out of **5** (worth checking out).

## Summary
The game takes place the solar system, Halcyon, and is dominated via corporate control. 
The story starts with the main protagonist escaping a ship set to colonize Halcyon by a scientist and is soon tasked to save the rest of the passengers aboard. 
Before escaping the player is met with a character customization that allows for overall skills and slight appearance changes. 
The appearance customization, however, seems to be in vain because during gameplay the player will almost never see the character as there is no third person view and is only viewed in the armor tab.
Speaking of UI, it is really simplified making for ease of use for viewing the map, changing armor, changing weapons, selecting quests and overall gameplay indicators (health, etc.).
The game also comes from the creators of Fallout: New Vegas, thus set my expectations for this game kind of high.
On that note, I didn't finish the game and spent only about 30+ hours in game.

On to gameplay, it can be simplified to fallout without the gunplay.
Note, I played the game on hard difficulty (story, normal, hard, supernova).
Guns in the game feel almost too simplified with mostly all gun types revolving around two variants of themselves, heavy and light. Melee weapons seemed to survive this, if only a little.
The game also features five damage types: physical, plasma, corrosion, shock, and n-ray.
Enemies, even on hard difficulty, felt way too easy, at least with rifles. I would find myself winning firefight against groups of enemies without the use of the inhaler thus leading to an abundance of healing items and buffs.
Weapons in game suffer a system of leveling in which keeps bring into light that there are so few guns, but you can choose to "upgrade" your weapon instead. 
The cost of upgrading your weapon is too high leading to you wanting to just find a "new" one or just buy one in the vending machine.
The leveling system of weapons and armor also kill the uniqueness of special weapons and science weapons (special weapons are the same guns, but with different stats).

Enough ranting on the gunplay, how about the story element?
Personally, I think they almost had it.
In games like Fallout and Skyrim, I love to listen to the story and read anything that I could get my hands on (except for the books in-game).
While I love how companions interact with the dialogue almost completely each with different opinions with different combinations almost made the game entirely.
They would interact with each other according to what the player was currently doing.
The thing that caused me to stop playing the game was the over setting of the corporate dominance.
In every nook and cranny of this game I was reminded of corporations in the items, guns, armor, computers, npc's, and even the loading screen.
I know that the base of the game is corporate takeover, but does it need to be everything?

With the dialogue comes its options, and they are at least done right, mostly.
You can choose to be a savant or be the bad guy (even an idiot if you choose low intelligence) facing skill checks along the way.
Though with skill checks in mind, it is important to bring up a fatal flaw in using your skill points.
The game would be fine in this regard if you weren't able to upgrade in bulk.
When upgrading a skill, you can upgrade an entire group of skill together until an individual skill reaches level 50.
The perks in the game gave useful effects such as increasing carry weight and max health while keeping a good balance while only unlocking them every other level up.

With the gameplay and story elements out of the way, the look of the game needs to be addressed.
In short, it is beautiful but too shiny.
The game features a glorious landscape of fauna and enemies (though not too many types).
Like other RPG games, this one is no different to keeping the same style of the areas and buildings, but this is not the problem.
The problem is when there is too many inaccessible buildings and far landscapes without meaning (thankfully there's fast travel).
Though appreciated at first, it does get to you once you notice that the entire game feels like it has a filter on with no escape.
Everything in the game tends to look like it is shiny, even things that should look rough like rocks look like candy.

## Final Thoughts
Overall, I think this game can be enjoyed wholeheartedly by fans of Fallout and Skyrim if they are able to overlook easy gameplay with the constant feel of "I hate my job". The game was made to be like fallout, but it ended up meeting it halfway.
