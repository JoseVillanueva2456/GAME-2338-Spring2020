# Game Review for Pokemon Lets Go Eevee

## Details

### Pokemon Lets Go Eevee

Game available for Nintendo Switch

### Rating

Overall, I would give this game a 3 out of 5 (worth checking out).

## Summary

Like the game predecessors, you are a pokemon trainer set to go out and catch pokemon filling the pokedex. Unlike its predecessors, the game took a massive plunge in the difficulty department. The game took its simple mechanics from the previous games such as catching pokemon, fighting, exploring, and brought them into HD. The nostalgia in this game is at an all-time high taking a setting similar to pokemon yellow bringing familiar gym leaders and pokemon to find. With the new looks comes another feature of petting your pokemon, although it is limited to the pokemon on the cover of the game you chose. Apart from looks, the overall combat is highly geared to accommodate the games targeted market making for very easy to win battles making the game too easy. Another feature that helps with making the game easy is that every pokemon is now leveled up as a group, which previously was determined on individual pokemons battle performance. As for catching pokemon, the original style of random encounters has been replaced with the pokemon visibly walking in the grass (also where random encounters occurred previously) that you can walk into triggering an encounter. As for capturing the pokemon, it has changed from fighting the pokemon then trying your luck to just being able to catch it from the get-go (at least the motion controls are neat).

## Final Thoughts

As for a pokemon game, I cannot recommend this game to anyone who is not in kindergarten. The game is too focused on children, which is not bad, but leaves fans disappointed. As for the nostalgia feel alone, I still cannot recommend it as will feel like a tech demo. One last gripe I have with this game was that fact that you could not use the pro controller with the game.
