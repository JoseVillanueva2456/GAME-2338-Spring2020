### Rating
Overall, I would give this game a **3** out of **5** (worth checking out).

## Summary
The game takes place the solar system, Halcyon, and is dominatated via corporate control. 
The story starts with the main protagonist escaping a ship set to colonize Halcyon by a scientist and is soon tasked to save the rest of the passengers aboard. 
Before escaping the player is met with a character customization that allows for overall skills and slight apperace changes. 
The apperace custiomization however, seems to be in vain because during gameplay the player will almost never see the character as there is no third person view and is only veiwed in the armor tab.
Speaking of UI, it is really simplfied making for ease of use for veiwing the map, changing armor, changing weapons, selecting quests and overall gameplay indicators (health, etc).
The game also comes from the creators of Fallout: New Vegas, thus set my expectations for this game kind of high.
On that note, I didn't finish the game and spent only about 30+ hours in game.

On to gameplay, it can be simplified to fallout without the gunplay.
Note, I played the game on hard difficulty.
Guns in the game feel almost too simplified with mostly all gun types having about two variants of themselves, heavy and light (excluding melee weapons which there seemed to be quite a few).

## Final Thoughts
IN PROGRESS
