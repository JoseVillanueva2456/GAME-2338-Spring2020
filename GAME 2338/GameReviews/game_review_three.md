### Rating

Overall, I would give this game a 4 out of 5 (really good).

## Summary

The game takes place in a small village where artifacts from recently discovered dungeons are popular.
You play as Will, the successor of a small shop called the moonlighter.
Will dreamed of exploring dungeons and finding loot, so he set forth to do so.
After his first failed attempt to explore the dungeons, he is aided from an old man who gives him a sword to start his adventures and mentions of obtaining better armor.
Simple enough, you start to explore dungeons and finding loot to sell. 
For gameplay, your basic move sets are to attack, block (if you have sword and shield), roll, and heavy attack.
Utilizing these basic moves, you can play half the game. You first go into a dungeon that are north of the small town and enter a portal, 
there you will be met with an assortment of monster with very easy to read attack patterns and special loot drops. Collecting the drops, you are set onto selling them at the moonlighter (your shop). The game has four basic difficulties; Easy, Normal, Hard (recommended in-game), Very Hard. If you played action top-down games like "Enter The Gungeon", you will find that on the difficulty that I played on (very hard), will be a breeze.

For more detail on combat, enemies have very simple attack patterns with the player just needing to dodge and attack, but with this simple playstyle there is a small catch. The player is met with facing many enemies at a time while needed to avoid floor traps. Floor traps in-game consist of holes, harmful substances (lava, poison, electricity), and falling ground blocks that are all in a pattern that is randomly generated. This paired with the many different enemies make for overwhelming experiences (at least in the beginning).
You're weapons choices are a sword and shield (normal damage, can block), big sword (big damage, slow), spear (normal damage, long range), fighter gloves (normal damage, fast, short range), and a bow (small damage, high range). The game allows you to use two that you can switch to on the fly. With weapons come armor in which there are just three basic types fabric (fast movement, lower defense), iron (normal movement/ defense), and steel (slow movement, big defense). 
As you progress through the game, it starts to become apparent that each dungeon ends up being mostly the same. Floor traps become easier, enemies become predictable, and the loot ends up being reskins of the previous dungeon. This however, is not entirely the fault of the game, but the player. The reason the player will end up sharpening their skills so fast is because of the games feature to randomly generate levels pushing you learn quick and fast. Even with the player constantly getting better, one of the best parts of the game is met with a challenge, dungeon bosses. These bosses are each unique, with their own attack patterns to push your skills to their limit, rewarding the player with special loot.

Speaking of loot, the game feature a great assortment of loot to be picked up, itâ€™s just too bad that most if it doesn't have any special purpose. All loot either drop from enemies or are obtained in chests found in dungeons (or bought from an unlockable character in town that overprices items). The loot is used to sell in the moonlighter (shop) or to make potions, armor, and weapons. The loot itself are put into several tiers of rarity (by cost) in the handy in-game notebook. Collecting loot, you can start your business. The game handles this by simply having you place items on display and letting customers react (either too happy, happy, contempt, angry, very angry). Using their reactions, you then can price your items accordingly which is also recorded in the notebook. This part of the game is very relaxing as you earn money to get new gear (items also needed). The shop has upgrades that amount to simple stat changes (more money earned, etc.), more display points, more storage, and even a better bed to allow for more defense in dungeons. The town can also be upgraded allowing access to more useful characters to help in your dungeoning. The upgrades in game are very basic in nature but give the player a reason to keep playing the game (along with the fun bosses).

Lastly, the look of the game. This, I feel was on par or even better to my enjoyment of the bosses. The game features a pixel art style with fluid animations. The town, even with a pixel style, feels so alive as you see the neighbor running about, trees moving, birds flying, and even cloud shadows overhead. The makers paid special attention to the look and feel to the game making sure that there is always moving objects whether it is a flame on a wall to a snail that you can crush. The game overall looks nice having easy to navigate menus (at least with controller) and moving background in dungeons while building the background story of the game through item descriptions or notebooks found along the way.

## Final Thoughts

I feel the game overall became repetitive, but not long (half good/ half bad). You go into a dungeon kill enemies, get loot, sell, upgrade, fight boss and then repeat three more times. My gameplay was short (7 hours), but overall fun. The weapons and armor didn't feel to unique to where it just came down to how did you want to look. The selling aspect was very simple but also very relaxing. Enemies became easy once you learned their move sets (which is one per enemy). The game looked absolutely fantastic. I loved staring at little pixel bugs crawl on the ground. Though it was released on pc, it was not made to be played on keyboard and mouse (it is told in-game that a controller is recommended). Overall, I had a lot of fun playing this game even though it became kind of repetitive, it wasn't dragged out too long which was nice.
