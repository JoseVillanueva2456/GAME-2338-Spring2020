### Rating

Overall, I would give this game a 4 out of 5 (really good).

## Summary

Quick summary, the game takes place in the planet of pandora where bandits thrive and order is almost non-existent. Following 
the events of the previous games, you are tasked to retrieve the lost vault key, 
but are met with the main antagonists of the game the calypso twins who are also after the vaults power. Like the previous games, you are able to choose from four characters to play from including FL4K (Beastmaster), Moze (Gunner), Zane (Operative) and Amara (Siren). Old players of from the franchise will find that their favorite playstyle is still available.
With the same playstyle also come the same skill trees that players (including myself) came to love with the added twist of being able to switch your action skills on the fly. Even with the characters keeping their same playstyle the game once again kept each class feeling unique from their old counterparts.

With the new set of characters come the addition of the new loot. Loot has always been a main part of the series seeing as people loved
to see that orange glow that they grew to love. Rarity stays the same as the others games from common (white), uncommon (green), rare (purple) to legendary (orange).
The guns in this game also have the main elements such as fire, corrosive, shock, cryo and radiation (slag, a element from the previous 2 games was removed). Guns in this game still feature their own manufacturers along with their own set of uses such as higher fire rates to adding more explosive power. Shields are still a core part of the game keeping the same functionality as before (better rarity = better defense usually). Players will be happy to find out that special legendary effects are still part this game. Another thing carried over is customization from their characters, vehicles (both in looks and functionality), and even their guns. These customizations can be found throughout the game or bought from crazy Earl from Sanctuary (Eriduim is now used here as well as obtaining anointed guns that have effects based on action skills).

As for the gameplay, it is pretty much the same old formula. You tread through an area, collect loot, and fight a boss (and collect even more loot, etc.). Enemies have their weaknesses as usual such as fire over flesh, shock over shields, corrosive over armor, cryo makes enemies slower (or freezes them), and radiation does an area of effect damage. The missions and story are as fun as before while almost everyone has their own quirk (for example Claptrap, a robot, has the player collect robot parts so he can make a girlfriend). Bosses like the other games have a unique fight style that players must learn in order to beat (like most other games as well). The only downside is that side missions don't really have a requirement to the story, which doesn't sound bad on paper, but does cause inconsistencies. For example, if you were to play the story and ignore the side missions, you will have a fun balanced playthrough. But if you were to choose to play the side missions you would earn EXP that will offset the main story making the next area too easy and leaving the loot earned outdated.

## Final Thoughts

Overall, the game just like you would expect from the previous games. I believe they managed to keep the same fun from the gunplay, looting, story, and customization. It even stays true to their signature cartoony comic style that the fans love. One of my gripes from this game and from the others is not keeping the side missions balanced as it leaves them to feel unimportant and even making the game to easy if you choose to play them. My other gripe comes with the UI being kind of sluggish as it takes a while to load the item menu (which is very noticeable on console).
