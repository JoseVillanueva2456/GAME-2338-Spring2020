### Rating

Overall, I would give this game a 4 out of 5 (really good).

## Summary

You start off as a parent of a child during a nuclear war hiding in an underground shelter frozen waiting out the nuclear holocaust.
Waking early, you see that your significant other is killed, and your child taken before being frozen again. You are unfrozen and set off in the world torn and burnt seeking revenge for your spouse and to find your abducted child.

Quick summary out the way, the main story is set, but is never required to do (unless you aim to complete the game). 
The player given the choice to do whatever they want from creating their character, choosing how to play, and even whether to build.
Returning players will come to expect open world freedom with interesting stories and characters while utilizing a system of skill checks (or violence). This expectation, however, is felt half-baked as the dialogue system is taken to a more simplified approach with little to no variation across the options (violence is still an option though). Aside from character dialogue, any records you find (computer logs, letters, etc.) are mostly kept interesting, but is somewhat stagnated from the surrounding setting of characters.

Apart from story, the combat will come to little surprise to returning players as the original light, heavy, energy, and melee weapons style is still in effect. The only change from some of previous titles is the way that "V.A.T.S." now slows the world down instead of stopping it entirely which was good refresh for most and hated from others (refresh for me). The new (improved) way of gun customization allowed players to create a great arsenal of "different" weapons but leaves little in the way of uniqueness as you can make almost any gun behave how you want it to. Another problem of uniqueness is the new way special weapons are now randomly generated regular weapons with added effects turning looking for original weapons into looking repeatedly trying to obtain a specific version of a weapon (which is good for those who like looter games, but a punch in the face for fans).

Going into the look of the game, it can be said that today it doesn't look too special, but when it first came out in 2015 fans and newcomers alike were fascinated to see an rpg delve into new (for the time) age graphics. Even by todayâ€™s standards (for most people) the game still holds up as a beautiful game. The games feature of god-rays (promoted at the time) made the land scape and indoors look as if it was actually being baked by the sun itself (before the bombs of-course). This complete with the original standard of the fallout look being brought into HD made for a sight to behold. 

## Final Thoughts

This game at the time was highly anticipated by fans (including me) and was mostly delivered its promise of a new fallout game, but feels a bit too changed to be enjoyable as its predecessors as if its wacky tone is exchanged for a more serious approach (outside of the main story). But even with this approach I can say the game is still enjoyable from listening to some oldies and reading any found records in the game.
