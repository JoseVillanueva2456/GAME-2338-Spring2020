### Rating

Overall, I would give this game a 4 out of 5 (really good).

## Summary

"Uncertain of his sister's fate, a boy enters LIMBO" (in "about this game", credited above), you play as a boy who is in a dark and surreal world playing a handful of puzzles. Limbo is a black and white puzzle game that focuses on timing and physics. The game starts, and ends, being confusing as it is never told why you are there or what you are supposed to do, but instead supplements that for simple gameplay and simple video game imagery.

Gameplay wise, this game can be played by a someone who has never played video games or someone looking for a relaxing experience. The game is entirely played with five buttons; four to move and one for actions. The game has you activate simple mechanisms and push or pull things, simple enough. The game has simple mechanics that include simple traps that kill the player, movement hindering, gravity changes, simple physics, climbing and some platforming.

The game itself is very simple in nature, but its main premise is in its art and background. Told nothing, the player is made to control a boy walking in a dangerous place trying not to die. Throughout the game you will see that the boy will need to face people trying to kill him and see a giant creature chasing him. The game shifts its tone dramatically from scene to scene making for a journey that is a little confusing, causing the game's name to have more of an affect.  

## Final Thoughts

Overall, the game was pleasing to play even years after the game was released while also having experienced some harder puzzles and platforming games. This is because I enjoyed the background scenery where the game tells a minimalistic story through scenery and experiences instead of dialogue or writing, hence the very little official information given on the store pages/box art. Though I enjoyed the game, I can't seem to recommend it as a game for its gameplay, but for its simple hidden story and dark-ish setting.
